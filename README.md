# MOVEMATE – Transport Management Console Application

A C-based transport (bus) management system developed as part of **Software Development Fundamentals (PBL)** during the first semester of B.Tech CSE at **Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida**.

---

##  Project Overview

MOVEMATE is a console-based application that simulates a basic transport booking and management system.  
It allows users to view routes, check seat availability, calculate occupancy, and simulate bookings.

---

##  Objectives

- Design a transport management system using C
- Apply core C programming concepts in a real-life scenario
- Practice modular programming and memory management
- Implement persistent storage using file handling

---

##  Features

- Multiple predefined bus routes
- Seat availability and occupancy calculation
- Multi-passenger booking simulation
- File handling for storing booking data
- Ticket-style confirmation output
- Simple and user-friendly console interface

---

##  Concepts Used

- Structures
- Functions
- File Handling
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc & free)
- Modular Programming

---

##  System Requirements

- GCC Compiler
- Windows / Linux
- Standard C Libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `math.h`)

---

## How to Run

```bash
gcc movemate.c -o movemate
./movemate
